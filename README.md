## What you are going to make?

We are going to build a remotely drivable car, with voice recognition capabilities.

---

## Why will you make it?

We want to simulate the experience of owning a vehicle: where the only thing that you have to do is talk to it in order to tell it where it needs to go.
We want the option for people to control a car with just their voice.

---

## What problem does it solve?

It solves the problem where people end up in accidents due to not having their attention on the road.

It can open up time to be productive or enjoy yourself while commuting.

In times of self isolation, our product makes the action of commuting by yourself more attractive than using public transport.

---

## How you are going to make it?

- We will use an application layer as the communication interface to control the car.
- An external library with voice recognition capabilities will be used as the foundation for the voice control.
- A network layer will be used for MQTT communication.

## What kind of technology you are going to use?

- C++
- Java
- Github
